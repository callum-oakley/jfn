# jfn

jfn is a tool for evaluating a JavaScript function and printing the result.

## Help

```
Evaluate a JavaScript function and print the result

Usage: jfn [OPTIONS] [BODY]

Arguments:
  [BODY]  The body of the JavaScript function to be evaluated [default: $]

Options:
  -j, --json-in   Parse input as JSON
  -y, --yaml-in   Parse input as YAML
  -t, --toml-in   Parse input as TOML
  -J, --json-out  Print output as JSON
  -Y, --yaml-out  Print output as YAML
  -T, --toml-out  Print output as TOML
  -h, --help      Print help
  -V, --version   Print version

Input is avaialable in BODY as $. Environment variables are available in BODY prefixed by $.
```

## Example

Suppose we have some JSON which contains [a bunch of superheros][] and we want to find the hero with
the power of "Immortality":

```
> curl https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json |
    jfn -jJ '$.members.find(m => m.powers.includes("Immortality"))'
{
  "name": "Eternal Flame",
  "age": 1000000,
  "secretIdentity": "Unknown",
  "powers": [
    "Immortality",
    "Heat Immunity",
    "Inferno",
    "Teleportation",
    "Interdimensional travel"
  ]
}
```

## Semantics

The provided `BODY` is evaluated by [V8][] as part of the expression `$ => BODY`. In particular,
this means that `BODY` must have the syntax of an [Arrow Function][] body: it can either be a single
expression, or multiple statements enclosed in braces with an explicit return statement.

`$` contains the result of reading STDIN as text, or of parsing it as JSON if the `-j` flag is set,
YAML if the `-y` flag is set, or TOML if the `-t` flag is set. If STDIN [is a terminal][] then `$`
is the empty string.

The result is printed to STDOUT after being [cast to a string][], or serialized as JSON if the `-J`
flag is set, YAML if the `-Y` flag is set, or TOML if the `-T` flag is set.

Environment variables are available in `BODY` prefixed by `$`. e.g. `USER` is available as `$USER`.

## Why?

JavaScript is a convenient language with which to process JSON (which stands for "JavaScript Object
Notation" after all), but the boilerplate of reading from STDIN, parsing, and writing to STDOUT
makes many could-be "one-liners" significantly more involved than they need to be. jfn provides a
thin wrapper around V8 which handles this boilerplate and makes it more ergonomic to sprinkle a
little JavaScript in to a shell script.

jfn can be used for many of the same tasks as [jq][]. A given jq command is often a little shorter
than the equivalent jfn command, but if (like the author) you find yourself often forgetting the
syntax of jq, and you already know JavaScript, you might find jfn easier to use. To see how jfn
compares to jq, check out the [translated jq tutorial][].
